# Password Generation Using AI
# AI-Based Password Generation & Strength Classification System

An advanced AI-driven system that leverages deep learning models to generate secure passwords and classify password strength. This project combines **RNNs, CNNs, and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** to analyze password patterns, assess complexity, and produce strong, policy-compliant passwords for cybersecurity applications.

##  Project Overview

This project aims to improve password security by applying machine learning techniques to:
- Learn real world password patterns  
- Classify password strength (weak, medium, strong)  
- Generate high-entropy passwords using a VAE-based model  

The system is designed for use in **password management tools, authentication systems, and cybersecurity platforms** to reduce the risk of weak or reused passwords.
